# Vortex Keyboard Custom Firmware

*Disclaimer: This project comes with no warranty, and may be used for free at your own risk. I do
this in my free time for fun, as such there are no guarantees of progress or success.*

For the reverse engineering effort on the original Vortex firmware and a tool to communicate
with Vortex keyboards, see [pok3r_re_firmware](https://github.com/ChaoticConundrum/pok3r_re_firmware).
